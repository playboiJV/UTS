            <h2>What makes your life meaningful?</h2>
            <p>And if you deem your life not meaningful, then what are the steps you can do to make it meaningful?</p>
            <p>To make life more meaningful, start by identifying your passions and interests, and pursue them actively. Set clear, achievable goals that align with your values and work towards them. Engage in activities that contribute to the well-being of others, such as volunteering or helping a neighbor. Surround yourself with supportive, positive people who inspire and uplift you.

        <p>One of the hardest lessons I learned is that failure is a part of growth and not a reflection of my worth. I cope with challenges by maintaining a positive mindset, seeking support from friends and family, and learning from each experience. Practicing resilience through small, consistent efforts helps me stay focused and motivated. I also make sure to take care of my mental and physical health through regular exercise and mindfulness practices. Ultimately, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth has strengthened my character and resolve.</p>
